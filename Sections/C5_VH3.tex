\section{Discriminant Variables}\label{sec-vh-disc}
The analysis leverages a varied set of reconstructed physical variables in the fit to constrain the different processes and control mis-modelling effects. Figure \ref{fig:variablesControlReg} displays the variables used for each control region in the fit in the resolved regime. The reconstructed Higgs mass directly offers some separation power of the signals from their major backgrounds, hence some control regions such as the Top $BT$ \gls{cr} and CRHigh are modelled with these relevant variables: $m_{bb}$, $m_{cc}$, and $m_J$, depending on the targeted decay and the regime. Some \gls{cr}s passed to the fit are modelled with the $p_T^V$ distribution, such as the CRHigh in the 2L-channel $NT$ and $BB$ tagged-regions and the $V+l$ \gls{cr} ($LN$-tag). Directly fitting this distribution helps constrain a Monte-Carlo mis-modelling in the \ptv\ distributions of the \textsc{Sherpa} 2.2.11 $V+$jets samples, as detailed in Section \ref{sec-mod}. To optimise signal and background separation in the statistical analysis, dedicated \gls{bdt}, also called \gls{mva}, are trained with the \textsc{TMVA} Root framework \cite{Therhaag:2011jh} in the signal regions of the combined analysis. Simple one-dimensional discriminants are built from the outputs of fine-tuned \gls{bdt}s trained on specific sets of event-level input variables, as described in greater detail in this section. \\

\subsection{Multivariate Analysis}
Three sets of discriminants are trained for the analysis: one set called \textit{\gls{mva}} discriminants for the signal region modelling, and a specific set called \textit{mvaCRLow} for the CRLow distribution in the resolved \vhb. An additional set of \gls{bdt}s is trained for the cross-check analysis targetting the diboson process as the signal, where one of the bosons is a $Z$ ($WZ$ or $ZZ$n summarised as $VZ$) with a $b\bar{b}$ or $c\bar{c}$ pair in the final state. For this purpose, the signal is set to the diboson process decaying into the expected pair of jets $VZ(\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ or $VZ(\rightarrow c\bar{c})$, and the non-diboson processes as well as the $VH$ processes are set as backgrounds. All multivariate discriminants predict a continuous score in the range $[-1, 1]$, with higher values indicating a signal-like component and lower values background-like.

The wide adoption of \gls{bdt}-discriminants in all regimes of the analysis marks a significant improvement over the standalone \vhc\ and boosted \vhb\ analyses, generalising the successful approach first introduced in the resolved \vhb\ \cite{ATLAS:2020fcp}. Before training, the object and event selections of Section \ref{sec-selectionandcat} and the jet energy corrections of Section \ref{sec-vh-jetcor} are applied. To limit the number of training runs and the risk of overtraining from the low statistics of some kinematic regions, the \gls{bdt}s are trained on inclusive regions combining the \gls{sr}s and the $\Delta R$-based \gls{cr}s (CRHigh and CRLow). The \gls{bdt}s are trained to discriminate the respective signal of the different targeted decays \footnote{The \vhb\ samples for the $BB$-tagged events and \vhc\ samples for the 1 and 2 $c$-tagged events.} from background samples, including $V+$jets, \ttb, single-top, and diboson. \gls{bdt}s were specifically trained in the following specific categories, covering the fine analysis categorisation to guarantee sufficient statistics and avoid overtraining:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Resolved \boldvhbc:} \gls{bdt}s are trained separately for the $BB$-, 2 $c$- ($TT+TL$ abbreviated $XT$), and 1 $c$-tags ($NT$). Separate trainings are run for each lepton channel and for the following jet multiplicities\footnote{The jet multiplicity only accounts for jets with $p_T > 30$ GeV.} and \ptv\ bins:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{0L}: separate \gls{bdt}s are trained for the 2-, 3-, and 4-jet categories, each in one inclusive \ptv\ $\geq 150$ GeV region.
      \item \textbf{1L}: separate \gls{bdt}s are trained for the 2- and 3-jet categories, each in two \ptv\ bins: \ptv\ $\in [75, 150]$ GeV and \ptv\ $\geq 150$ GeV.
      \item \textbf{2L}: separate \gls{bdt}s are trained for the 2- and $\geq$3-jet categories in two \ptv\ bins: \ptv\ $\in [75, 150]$ GeV and \ptv\ $\geq 150$ GeV.
  \end{itemize}
  The low \ptv\ bin is separated from the higher \ptv\ $>$ 150 GeV due to its large statistics and different background compositions.
  \item \textbf{Boosted \vhb:} one \gls{bdt} is trained per lepton channel in an inclusive bin of \ptv\ $\geq$ 400 GeV.
\end{itemize}

For training, the full \gls{mc} samples statistics in all analysis regimes are used thanks to the so-called \textit{GNN truth tagging}. Instead of filtering down the simulated samples by cutting away events failing to pass the flavour tagging requirements - the standard application of the selection called \textit{direct tagging} -, this technique applies a weight to each event to represent its probability of passing the tagging selection. The result is a weighted distribution possessing the statistical precision of the full \gls{mc}-samples but shaped as the directly tagged distributions. The weights in this truth tagging procedure are predicted by a \gls{gnn}-based neural network passed event-level information, with more details given in Appendix \ref{app-truth-tagging}. The truth tagging procedure is applied to $BB$ for \vhb, and to $TT$, $TL$, and $NT$ for \vhc. The variables used for each lepton channel in both regimes are listed in Table \ref{tbl:MVAVars}, with more precise definitions of each variable given in Appendix \ref{ap-MVA}. Features with long tails are clipped to contain 99\% of the centred distributions, and given a specifically chosen default value when they are not defined for an event. The sets of features used are the result of hyperparameter optimisation campaigns, with many other variables tested but eventually not included due to their negligible impact on the performance. 

\input{Tables/VH/MVAInputs.tex}

The architectures of the different \gls{bdt}s are optimised, with the gradient boosting technique of Section \ref{sec-gradient-boost} deployed in the resolved regime to improve performance and to capture effects outside the bulk of the distributions. In the boosted regime, due to the lower statistics available and large tails in the distributions, the AdaBoost method - introduced in Section \ref{sub-adaboosted} - is adopted to help stabilise the training \cite{Adaboost}. Tables \ref{tbl:MVAHyperparams} and \ref{tbl:MVAHyperparams-VHcc} list the architectures used for the \vhb\ and \vhc\ \gls{bdt}s respectively, with the main and diboson \gls{bdt}s sharing the same hyperparameters. For \vhc, the hyperparameters are further tuned to avoid overtraining from the smaller available statistics in the 2L channel and the diboson cross-check.

Trainings are performed with the $k$-fold method, setting $k = 2$, to use the full statistics while assessing the overtraining risk. In other words, each \gls{bdt} is doubly trained: once on odd events, and once on even events. The performance is assessed on the held-out fold and the final discriminant is the combination of the odd- and even-trained \gls{bdt}s, thereby exposed to the whole training set. Additional overtraining checks are performed on each fold-training, comparing the trained distribution to a test distribution obtained by applying the \gls{bdt} on the heldout set for the fold, as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:overtrainingCheck}. The \gls{bdt}s deliver a good discrimination performance, with a typical \gls{auc} of the \gls{roc} of $\sim0.9$ and a large increase on the expected statistical significance of the analysis compared to using the Higgs candidate mass as discriminating variable. \\
  
In addition to the signal and cross-checks \gls{mva}s, extra \gls{mva}s are trained for the \vhb\ resolved 1L channel in the \lowdr\ \gls{cr} (CRLow). This region is dedicated to the $W+$jets process, with a rich contribution of the important $W+bb$ background. At low \ptv, there is unfortunately also a large contribution from \ttb, reducing the purity of the $W+bb$ in the \gls{cr}. To recover a higher sensitivity to this background, \gls{mva}s are specially trained to discriminate the $W+bb$ process from other backgrounds in the CRLow $BB$-tagged events. They are similarly trained with 2-fold on truth tagged samples, separately for the \ptv\ $< 150$ GeV and \ptv\ $> 150$ GeV and in a single inclusive jet multiplicity bin by combining the 2- and 3-jet categories. The typical \gls{auc} of these discriminants is $\sim0.84$, with no overtraining observed.

\subsection{Output Variable Transformation}
The output of the \gls{bdt}s introduced in the previous section delivers a fine-binned \gls{mva} variable maximising the separation of signal from backgrounds. To optimise the sensitivity of the statistical analysis, the \gls{mva} distributions are rebinned such that low \gls{bdt} scores are still indicative of a background-like event while large values are signal-like. This rebinning is performed with attention given the statistical uncertainty in each bin and the final sensitivity of the discriminant score. The combined analysis applies the so-called \textit{Transformation D} algorithm. The technique relies on a per bin score $Z$ defined as
\begin{equation}
    Z = z_s \frac{n_s}{N_s} + z_b \frac{n_b}{N_b},
\end{equation} 
where $N_s$ ($N_b$) is the total number of signal (background) events, $n_s$ ($n_b$) the number of signal (background) events in a specific bin, and $z_s$ and $z_b$ are tunable parameters indirectly controlling the number of signal- and background-enriched bins desired in the region. For a given choice of $z_s$ and $z_b$, the algorithm starts from the initial binning of the \gls{bdt}s and successively recombines bins from the higher bin values (right) to the lower values (left). Successive bins of the original distribution are merged until the combined bin reaches a score $Z > 1$, thanks to increases in $n_s$ and $n_b$. Once a combined bin reaches the desired scores, it is removed from consideration and the algorithm re-starts from the highest bin not yet recombined (one bin to the left of the last rebinned one).\\

The $z_s$ and $z_b$ parameters are manually tuned for each analysis regime and lepton channel, giving signal regions with a final amount of \gls{bdt} bins varying from 4 to 15, as displayed in the postfit plots of Appendix \ref{appsec-vh-analRegPosfit}. An additional protection is added to avoid bins with too few data or \gls{mc} statistics, by requiring at least 3 signal + background events per bin after transformation. The specific tunes of the parameters for the different regimes of the combined analysis are presented in Table~\ref{tab:trafoDParams}.
